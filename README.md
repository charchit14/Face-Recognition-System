# About this program
This program recognizes face by comparing the live face (detected via webcam) with saved images(faces).

Run this program and you will see a window appear on your screen which is basically the webcam window capturing the live footage.

If your webcam detects the live image and if the corresponding image matches with the saved image on your directory, you will see a text with the corresponding person's name. Also, a '.csv' file will be created on your directory where the file name will be the present date and inside the file you will see the corresponding person's name and the time when the face was detected.

If you close the window and re-run the program the previous data will be over-written. So, if you want to detect multiple faces without over-writing the data then close the window only after all the faces are detected.

## NOTE:
Make sure that you save your image or the images that you want to detect in the 'faces' folder of this program and edit the program by renaming the images name accordingly.
